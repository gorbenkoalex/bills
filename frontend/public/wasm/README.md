# ONNX Runtime WebAssembly assets

Place the ONNX Runtime wasm binaries and loader shims generated by `npm run copy:onnx-wasm` or downloaded from the official release bundle in this directory. They are ignored by Git, but this README remains tracked so the folder exists in fresh checkouts.

Typical contents after running the helper:
- `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.wasm`
- `ort-wasm.wasm`
- `ort-wasm-simd-threaded.jsep.mjs`
- `ort-wasm.jsep.mjs`

If you see MIME-type or fetch errors when loading the ONNX runtime, ensure these files are present and that your static server serves `.wasm` with the `application/wasm` content type.
